# Introduction

  - CICDash helps visualize GitHub Actions metrics over time, providing insights into your workflow trends. By connecting to GitHub's REST API, CICDash extends the storage of your workflow metrics beyond GitHub's 90-day retention period.
By storing a history of your GitHub workflow metrics, trends can be more easily identified, saving time locating and debugging any issues that appear throughout development.

  - Workflow Runs by Month, Lifetime Workflow Attempts, Average Run Time: Monthly vs Lifetime (seconds) - Two different graphs for this one, Execution Time (seconds), Failure Rate By Job Step
